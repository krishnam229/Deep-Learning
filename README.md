# Deep Learning–Based Prediction of NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Duration Using Weather Data

This repository contains two major projects completed for **CS672 – Introduction to Deep Learning (Fall 2025)** at Pace University:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of NYC Yellow Taxi Trips – Project 1**  
2. **Deep Learning Regression Models for Trip Duration Prediction – Project 2**

The goal is to understand factors influencing taxi ride durations and build neural network models that accurately predict trip time using enriched features, including NYC weather conditions.

# 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (Project 1)

This notebook performs comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Records from 2020.

### Objectives
- Create a **training dataset** using March 2020 trips and an **evaluation dataset** using May 2020 trips.  
- Clean and prepare data by handling missing values, nulls, NaNs, and outliers.  
- Transform categorical and date-time features into numerical formats suitable for modeling.  
- Understand data types and distributions (numeric and categorical).  
- Generate visual and statistical summaries using:
  - **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**
  - **TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)** + Apache Beam  
- Identify significant features influencing **trip duration**.

### Key Outcomes
- A fully cleaned and processed dataset.  
- Insights into variable relationships and trends.  
- Strong foundation for model training in Project 2.

# 2. Deep Learning Regression for Trip Duration Prediction (Project 2)

This project builds and compares multiple neural network architectures to predict NYC Yellow Taxi trip duration using both **trip features** and **weather data**.

### Steps Performed
- Retrieved NYC climate data for January 2020 from Meteostat.  
- Merged weather data with taxi records based on date.  
- Scaled numeric features using StandardScaler.  
- Developed and trained three neural network models:
  1. **Linear Regression (no hidden layers)**  
  2. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**  
  3. **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** with dropout and deeper architecture  

### Training Configuration
- **Loss Functions:** MSE, MAE  
- **Optimizers:** SGD, Adam, RMSprop  
- **Learning Rates:** 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001  
- **Epochs:** 100  
- **Batch Size:** 32  

Training and validation loss curves were analyzed to assess model stability and accuracy.

### Best Model
Based on validation MAE:

> **DNN with RMSprop (lr = 0.001)**  
> Showed the most stable and accurate performance.

# 4. Model Performance Summary

| Model                     | Optimizer | Learning Rate | Val MAE | Val MSE |
|---------------------------|-----------|----------------|---------|---------|
| Linear Regression (TF)    | Adam      | 0.001          | 0.29    | 0.84    |
| MLP (2 Hidden Layers)     | RMSprop   | 0.001          | 0.24    | 0.56    |
| DNN (Deep Neural Network) | RMSprop   | 0.001          | **0.19** | **0.32** |

### Interpretation
- The **DNN model** performed best due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships.  
- The **MLP** showed moderate accuracy with mild overfitting.  
- **Linear Regression** underperformed, confirming that trip duration prediction benefits from deeper architectures.
